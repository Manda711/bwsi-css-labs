Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Derived from LeetCode problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/ (leetcode easy)
